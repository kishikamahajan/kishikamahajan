Hi there 👋
My name is Kishika Mahajan and I am a Public Policy student at the University of Chicago where I specialise in Data Analytics. During my time at UChicago, I gained a strong foundation in several programming languages, including Python, R and gained expertise in spatial data science.

Feel free to explore the following projects/coursework below to get a better sense of my skills and interests:

🏞️ [Commercialisation of National Parks in India](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/commercialisation_national_park): This project analyzes the impact of national park commercialization in India by exploring forest cover changes and economic activity in Jim Corbett and Pench Tiger Reserve using SHRUG data.

⚖️ [Predicting Recidivism Rates in California](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/compas_alt_risk_assessment_score): This project develops a stacking model (Random Forest + XGBoost) to predict recidivism, comparing its fairness and accuracy with the COMPAS risk assessment tool.

🔌 Forecasting Electricity Usage (December 2023): Used time series modeling (Regression with ARIMA errors and ELS) to model and forecast monthly residential electricity usage in California. All code was written in R and all analysis is summarized in the final presentation deck.

🐀 Predicting Neighborhood-Level Rat Activity in New York City (September 2023): Created a time series predictive model to forecast the volume of weekly rat-related 311 requests in each neighborhood, informing mitigation strategy for NYC Rat Czar.

🏠 Finding comparable properties with LightGBM (June 2023): Developed a new feature, the "comparable finder," into the R package lightsnip which enables accurate identification of comparable properties crucial for assessing property values in Cook County. Read more here for a longer explanation of this project.

🩻 Predicting Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray Images (May 2023): Working alongside three classmates, we used LeNet and Logistic Regression to predict pneumonia using chest X-Ray images with 99.4% recall accuracy, after implementing different image transformations in pytorch!

📈 COVID-19 Online: How people interacted with government websites during the pandemic (March 2023): Working alongside three classmates, we built a complete data pipeline (from collection to visualization) to explore web traffic to HHS websites during the pandemic.

📖 Scraper for Chicago Maps Archive (Feb 2023): In my role as digialization specialist for the University of Chicago Library System Special Collection's Department, I reconfigured data made publicly available by the Chicago History Museum to help process and digitize the maps for public use by University of Chicago Library's Preservation Departments.

📓 CAPP Coursework (Aug 2022-Present): This repository gives a better sense of the programming assignments that I've completed through my coursework to-date that showcase my technical abilities. My code for each assignment listed is available upon request.

📝 Publications (Aug 2018-Present): This repository has a list of my recent publications from my time as a researcher at the Urban Institute's Office of Race and Equity Research.
