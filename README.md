**Hi there 👋**

I am Kishika Mahajan and I am a Public Policy graduate from the University of Chicago where I specialised in Data Analytics adn Econometrics. During my time at UChicago, I gained a strong foundation in several programming languages, including Python, R and gained expertise in spatial data science, Machine Learning, advanced econometrics, among other techincal skills.

Feel free to explore the following projects/coursework below to get a better sense of my skills and interests:

🏞️ [Commercialisation of National Parks in India](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/commercialisation_national_park): This project analyzes the impact of national park commercialization in India by exploring forest cover changes and economic activity in Jim Corbett and Pench Tiger Reserve using SHRUG data.

⚖️ [Predicting Recidivism Rates in California](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/compas_alt_risk_assessment_score): This project develops a stacking model (Random Forest + XGBoost) to predict recidivism, comparing its fairness and accuracy with the COMPAS risk assessment tool.

🦠 [Differential Impacts of COVID-19 in India](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/spatial_cluster_analysis_covid_deaths): This study analyzes district-level data in the Indo-Gangetic Plain, focusing on pollution, healthcare, and demographic factors using PCA and K-Medoids clustering.

📈 [Non-Natural Causes of Death in Cook County](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/non_natural_deaths_cook_county): This project creates a multi-page dashboard to analyze non-natural deaths in Cook County, using data visualization and spatial analysis to highlight geographic disparities and inform targeted interventions.

⛪ [Churches in Goa, India](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/goa_churches_data): This project scrapes detailed information about Goa’s historic churches from [this website](https://goanchurches.info/) using a Python script and enriches the data by extracting precise geographic coordinates via Google APIs with an R script.

🦠 [Predicting Diseases in Tanzania](https://github.com/kishikamahajan/predicting_diseases_tanzania/tree/main): This project builds an ML model to predict disease cases at healthcare facilities using climate data from water sources, toilets, and waste management sites nearby.
